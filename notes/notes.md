# My Notes
## A Memoir by Ryan Callahan

### Git / Github
- Used for version control and collaboration
- Basic commands are:
  ```
  git status
  git add
  git commit -m "your message here"
  git push
  git pull
  git clone
  ```
- Remember: merge conflict bad (except when it's good)
- I actually knew all that already. Been doing it at work for about a year now
